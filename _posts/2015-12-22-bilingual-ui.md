title: Bilingual UI
---

During the course of working on [MedixCo](http://www.medixco.org/), a not-so-large project that was desired to be available in two languages, Persian (as the primary one) and English, I realised how challenging it is to design a bilingual user interface. Along with having a simple UI, it was intended to be fast and responsive.

Despite the fact that almost all of the back-end development was a cinch, thanks to the Laravel Framework, there was still one thing I had to decide on: the way the owner could administrate the content. Whether to redirect him to separate admin areas (per language) or to present everything there was via a single area (the problem being the content direction, RTL/LTR). As I didn’t really relish the fact that while most of the things were going to be identical and sort of duplicated on both sides, the admin had to switch between different panels, I went for the latter option and combined the two.

The challenge of designing a bilingual user interface was one that I had to approach with a lot of care and consideration. In order to ensure that the website would be both fast and responsive, I had to consider how best to enable the owner to administrate the content for both languages without making it too complex or time-consuming.

My solution was to combine the Persian and English content into one single administrator panel, allowing the owner to easily switch between them. This enabled both versions of the website to be configured in one go while avoiding having to duplicate content across different panels. Additionally, this ensured that all features were fully configurable and within easy reach.

To ensure that the interface was as user-friendly as possible, I also took into account other design elements, such as layout and organization. By making sure that all relevant information was properly categorized and displayed in a clear way, users could easily browse through the website’s content without getting overwhelmed by extraneous information. Additionally, I also made sure that all buttons were intuitively placed so that users could access essential features quickly and easily.

Overall, my goal was to create an interface that was both user-friendly and efficient for the owner when managing bilingual content on MedixCo. My solution succeeded in achieving this goal, providing an efficient way for users to navigate between different versions of the website without having to switch between separate panels or duplicate content across them.
